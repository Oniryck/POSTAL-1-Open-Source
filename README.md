OVERVIEW: <br />
This repository is an open source clone of the 1997 video game Postal. Is was developed by Running wish Scissors and published by Ripcord Games. Twenty years after its release at the end of 2016,
the original code base was made open source so that fans could have unrestricted access and the ability to modify the game, as well as give much of the general public access to what was essentially a
deprecated, inaccessible title.
The game is available for download on the Steam store for free. <br />
<br />
INSTALLATION: <br />
If one wishes to use the game files here instead of downloading them from another source 
after legally acquiring the rights to the game, install git and navigate to a local directory that can be used as a space to download the files. 
Use the command 'git clone' followed by the cloning link provided by clicking the green code button at the top of the page. 
Once the files have been downloaded to the local folder, navigate to it in the command line and run the 'make' command to build an executable file of the game.
Navigate to the folder that the 'make' command was run in and run the game by clicking on the newly created executable file.<br />
<br />
ALTERNATIVE SOURCE: <br />
Link for download of game without git or making executable: https://store.steampowered.com/app/232770/POSTAL/ <br />
The above link can be used to skip the cloning of the git repository through the creation of a Steam account and downloading of Steam.
In addition to this being a shortcut, it can be used to compare functionality with the open source version to check if there are any differences in the code base.<br />

TROUBLESHOOTING: <br />
There are small optimizations that can be made when running this program on a modern computer, as using Windows 10 or newer can create problems with older programs 
and may require the user to run the executable in compatibility mode. This can be accomplished by right clicking on the
program executable and clicking on the properties button at the bottom of the context menu.
Once the small settings window is opened, navigate to the compatibility tab and check the box that says 
'Run this program in compatibility mode for', and choose Windows Vista from the drop down menu.
Further issues can be troubleshot through the button above the checkbox in the properties menu, and additional resources are available online.
